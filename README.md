# Disclaimer
**This is a collection of old websites that I have made for myself**, keep in mind that this code was poorly written, and contains several bugs, of which i will not give any support, use at your own risk.

Also, I removed all the images, since I made this code public domain.

When using this project, you will notice that the site will break due to missing files, I encourage you to add your own.
