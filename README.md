**This is a old website that I have made**, keep in mind that this code was poorly written, and contains several bugs, of which i will not give any support, use at your own risk.

I also removed all the images, since I made this code public domain.

So, when using this project you will notice that the site will break, due to missing files, I encourage you to add your own files.
